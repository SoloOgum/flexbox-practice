    <!-- It is also possible to change the direction of the flex line. -->
    <!-- If we set the direction property to rtl (right-to-left), the text is drawn right to left,
         and also the flex line changes direction, which will change the page layout: -->
         <!-- The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items inside the flex container. 
            The default value of flex-direction is row (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). -->
<!-- 
            The other values are as follows:
            row-reverse - If the writing-mode (direction) is left to right, the flex items will be laid out right to left
            column - If the writing system is horizontal, the flex items will be laid out vertically
            column-reverse - Same as column, but reversed -->
